    <h1>The Yellow Brick Code: My Journey Through Programming</h1>
    <h2>A New Beginning</h2>
      <p>Hi, Everyone! My name is Matt. I am a "programmer" in the simplest of forms.
        At least, that is what my instructor and all the educational websites tell me.
        I am currently in my first week of a long journey to become a "Front-End Developer".
        My hope for this blog is to educate and enlighten those who have ever thought about delving
        into the world that is computer programming, but have been scared/unsure as to how to start or wondered if they would
        ever be successful within this industry. The computer science industry has many unknowns to outsiders who have ever
      have only heard of coding through watching movies like "The Social Network" or "The Internship" (great movies, btw).
    I am here to tell you that it can be as scary, confusing, and mysterious as it sounds.</p>
      <p> For starters, let me provided some background on myself. I am about close to 4 years out of college, graduating with an underwhelming
        Bachelors degree of Psychology. I currently work in the mental health industry at one of the top psychiatric hospitals in the country,
        planning inpatient admissions for mentally-ill individuals. Working in mental health can be interesting and overwhelming all at the same
        time. It can also burn people out extremely quickly. Which leads me to my purpose here. Over the last few months,
        I have been pondering a career change to a different field and that path has led me to the field of computer programming.
        With no experience (and no clue, really) I began taking free classes at codecademy.com and signed up for a coding "bootcamp".
        As of tonight, I just finished my second class and have picked up a general knowledge of how to put words into a text editor and
        make it look halfway legible.</p>

        <p>Here is a list of keywords I've picked up on so far:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Atom:text editor where you write actual code</li>
            <li>GitHub:file sharing and project collaboration site</li>
            <li>Git:command line interface-used to find/move files from your computer to GitHub</li>
            <li>Document Object Model(DOM):general layout/setup when coding in HTML documents (like this one!)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>I have experienced many emotions in my life, but few have compared to the first few hours of "learning to program". The emotional rollercoaster
          is unlike anything I have gone through before. I went from feeling like I knew nothing, to knowing "everything", back to not even being sure if I had the skills
          to turn off my computer. And that was all on Day 1.</p>

          <p>Like with my coding skills, my writing/blogging skills are fairly raw. So I hope both continue to develop together and this blog can help others looking to
            try programming. I hope to take screen grabs from each post and track how my programming skills develop after each week in terms of content and design of the site.</p>

          <p>My first piece of advice (if I am even qualified to do that)</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Be Patient-learning and eventually understanding the basics can take time</li>
              <li>Keep an open mind-you're always going to be learning through this process. Be prepared to be frustrated and uncomfortable while learning a new topic</li>
              <li>Have Fun!-learning and succeeding at programming should be enjoyable. Take time to enjoy your accomplishments!</li>
            </ul>
